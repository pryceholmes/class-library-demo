# class-library-demo
Class Project - c++ OO programming example

This project was the final c++ project for CSE 240 at ASU. The program was partially completed when the assignment was given.
The main file is the hw7.cpp file, all over files are class files or header files for hw7.cpp. 
Follow along with the comments to show what was already written, but most of the program was written by me. 
The assignment instructions, and more info can be found in the comments of the hw7.cpp file.
