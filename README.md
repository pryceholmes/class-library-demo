# class-library-demo
Class Project - c++ OO programming example

This project was the final c++ project for CSE 240 at ASU. The program was partially completed



You are given a partially completed program that creates a list of rooms.
Each room has name, number of rooms and library type (hayden or noble).
This information is stored as an object of Room class. Class defined in room.h
The classes Hayden and Noble are child classes of the Room class.
When adding a new room, these child classes are used to make the room node of the list.
So each node in the list is actually an object of either Hayden or Noble class.
